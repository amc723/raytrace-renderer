# raytrace-renderer
a tiny raytrace renderer written in C++ following Peter Shirley's "Raytracing in One Weekend". Uses the glm library.

## Building

I need to write a script to compile this outside of Visual Studio.
Currently, that's the easiest way to compile and run. 
There is a VS .sln file at the top of the repo.

## Renders

Check out the `raytrace_renderer/render_gallery` directory for some sample images that were generated. 
They're in the .ppm image format. You may need to use Gimp/Photoshop/Inkscape/etc. to open them.
TODO... Images as pngs or jpgs, or something more reasonable than ppm files.
